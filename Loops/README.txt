Prompt:
Prompt asking for a number
for loop that loops through the input number of times (So If I put in 5, it should loop through 5 times)
Every time through the loop, add the index of that loop to the input number then print that to a line in the HTML (So the first iteration should be 5+0, then 5+1)
Each number should be on a separate line
