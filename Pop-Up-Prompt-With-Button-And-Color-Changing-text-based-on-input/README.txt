Prompt:

Have a prompt appear on your web page, asking for the user's favorite color.
On the web page, there is a button. When the user clicks on this button, it writes the value the user input for the prompt onto the webpage.
When the user hovers over the color text, it should change the text color to the actual color "so if I wrote red, the color of the word should change to red"
When I hover off the word, it should return to the default color of black
