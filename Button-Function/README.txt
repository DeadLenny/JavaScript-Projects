A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/tansing/pen/ZNNyNJ.

Prompts:
The input for the name must be at least 2 characters in length
The input for the number must be a number that is between 0-100 only
Once I am able to submit, it should clear the value inside my input boxes and add the student's name and grade to a list below my inputs
Adding another student should add to this list of students. It doesn't need to save every time I visit the webpage, but for that visit, all of the students' names and grades should save
Every time there is an error in the inputs, notify me what is wrong somewhere IN THE HTML PAGE I CAN SEE
