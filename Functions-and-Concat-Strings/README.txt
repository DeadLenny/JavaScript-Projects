A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/tansing/pen/pmgKRp.


 Prompt: 
 
 Create three prompts. One asking for the user's name, then one asking for the user's favorite candy and one for their least favorite. Ask these same questions again for another user

Create two functions. The first one will take the name and favorite candy and write "Hi! My name is (name here), and my favorite candy is (candy here)". The second will take the name and least liked candy and write "Hi, the name is (your name here) and (least favorite candy) is terrible!"

Call both of these functions twice after the prompts, so I should see each message written twice. The first set should be for the first user's inputs, while the second set should be for the second user's inputs.
