Prompt:
You will be creating an actual form with validation.

You will have 4 input tags

Name
 The username must be "FinalUsername"
 If not, tell the user "Incorrect username"
Password
 The password is "finalPassword"
 If not, tell the user "Incorrect password"
Confirm Password
 The password is the same as the above password
 If not, tell the user "Password does not match"
Age
 Age must be 18 years or older
If not a numerical value, say "Must be a number"
 If below 18, say "You are not old enough to visit this site"
When I click a submit button, error messages should appear if it exists. If no errors, say "Submitted Correctly!"

Each one of these error messages listed must appear when the error is achieved and must be removed once the input is correct when clicking on the submit button. That means if both the error message for username and password exist, then I need to see both of those errors displayed on the screen
