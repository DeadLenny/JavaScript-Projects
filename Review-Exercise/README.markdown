Prompt:
Write an application where the user inputs their name, favorite animal, their favorite number, and their favorite letter via input tags.

Under the input tags, a button resides. When I click on the button

The value of the name input appears
If the animal is a dog, cat, or fish...
If a dog, write "woof woof"
If a cat, write "meow meow"
If fish, write "blub blub"
Otherwise, write "Annoying sounds"
Take the sum of the user's number and 6 and write it to the HTML
If the letter value is
Not a letter, say "not a letter"
If more than two characters, say "not one letter". You cannot limit the input to just 1 character either
If all correct, write "The cool letter is (your letter here"
When adding the favorite animal, the animal should be added to an array of animals listed to in the HTML. So if I wrote a dog and clicked the button, I should see the only dog. If the next time I write a cow and click the button, I should see "Dog, Cow", separated by a comma.

Every time I click the button, it should write over the result of the original inputs. I should not see a list of lists every time I click on a button
